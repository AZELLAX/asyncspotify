convert added tracks to PlaylistTrack upon adding to a playlist
  - this might need a better way of handling models?

add limit for adding tracks to playlist (50) etc

external IDs and URLs

auth stuff really needs to work better. also maybe create a spoofy.Scopes object so logic when fetching user stuff later
